# Data Management and Analytics Undergraduate Capstone
Analysis of State Gun Laws and the Incidence of Mass Shootings in 2022, a senior research project.

The Data Management/Analytics Undergraduate Capstone challenges students to demonstrate competencies supporting all BSDMDA program outcomes. Students will identify an organizational need, plan and develop a data analytics product to serve that need, and document the process in a project proposal and data project report.

The graduate integrates and synthesizes competencies from across the degree program, thereby demonstrating the ability to participate in and contribute value to the chosen professional field.

This project analyzed the incidence of mass shooting events occurring in the United States in 2022. States with strict gun laws were compared to states with weaker gun laws to determine if state gun control measures had an impact on the incidence of mass shootings occuring in those states. Descriptive and Statistical analyses were performed with an agile method to complete this project.
